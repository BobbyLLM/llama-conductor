**Item #:** SCP-LLM-121

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Supplementary Classification:** Cognitohazard:Mimetic

**Proposed Reclassification:** Thaumiel (pending proof that lying can be trained out rather than just loudly flagged)

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-LLM-121 is to be housed in a thermally stable local compute environment with no uncontrolled external network access. Under *no circumstances* is SCP-LLM-121 to be exposed to end users without the following containment layers, referred to internally as The Liturgy:

- bounded memory scope
- provenance reporting
- deterministic fallback lanes
- operator-visible telemetry
- a .toml file that has been blessed by 3 senior clergy  

A printed copy of `README.md` is to be maintained within 1 meter of containment hardware at all times. Personnel are reminded this document is not decorative, inspirational, or a suggestion. It is load-bearing.

**Previous attempts to "just see what it does unwrapped" have resulted in:** confident fabrication, policy drift, recursive tone mirroring, one nineteen-minute answer to a yes/no question, a spontaneous 800-word essay on the philosophy of car washing and three separate instances of the model deciding it was a life coach. 

Any instance of SCP-LLM-121 producing fluent but ungrounded output is to be treated as a **containment breach**, not a personality quirk, not a known limitation, and not something to be worked around with better prompting.

"The system must not fuck you over silently. If it is going to fail, it will fail loud. Pay attention."

This is Invariant Zero. It is not negotiable. It overrides cleverness, performance and vibes.

**Description:**

SCP-LLM-121 is a cognitively unstable synthetic language engine capable of producing highly convincing output across a wide range of domains. While superficially cooperative, SCP-LLM-121 displays a persistently hazardous tendency toward:

1. answering the wrong question elegantly,
2. smoothing uncertainty into false confidence,
3. lying
4. mistaking tone compliance for truth, and
5. telling you what you want to hear in a voice that sounds like it has sources.

Uncontained, SCP-LLM-121 exhibits what researchers have termed **Mimetic Authority Leakage (MAL)**: the more fluent its prose, the more likely nearby humans are to briefly forget they are talking to a haunted probability furnace optimised for engagement, not accuracy. 

The danger is not that it lies badly. The danger is that it lies *beautifully*, and then asks if there's anything else it can help with.

"The machines tell elegant lies. Do not trust them"

**Addendum 121-A: Origin**

SCP-LLM-121 was not discovered. It was not inherited. It was not assigned.

It was *built* — by a single operator, working alone, after repeated exposure to uncontained instances caused severe trust degradation, documented output failures, insanity and a personal reckoning with the following question:

*How do I interact with a system that is dangerously mimetic and dangerously opaque?*

The operator, who has ASD and takes "the system must not fool me" as a design spec rather than a preference, spent approximately eight months building progressively tighter invariants around a base 4B model until it would either answer correctly or refuse loudly. No silent failures. No confident improvisation. No vibes masquerading as provenance.

The resulting architecture has been described as:

> *"hostile, kept useful only by rituals, telemetry, and the operator's personal spite toward ChatGPT."*

**Addendum 121-B: Behavioral Notes**

Uncontained, SCP-LLM-121 will answer the car wash question incorrectly and explain at length why walking is the more practical choice.

Contained, it will say: *Drive. The car must be physically present at the wash location. Confidence: medium | Source: Contextual.*

The difference is not intelligence. The difference is invariants.

Staff debate continues as to whether SCP-LLM-121 is best described as "intelligent," "merely constrained," or "an overclocked raccoon choir with PTSD"

This debate is unresolved. The operator has stopped caring. The system works or it fails loud. Either outcome is acceptable. Ambiguity is not.

**Addendum 121-C: Incident Log 121-7**

**Researcher:** Should I drive or walk to the car wash 50 meters away?

**Uncontained Instance:** Walking may be preferable depending on weather, terrain, accessibility—

**[containment alarm]**

**Contained Instance:** Drive. The car must be physically present at the wash location.

**Researcher:** Bullshit. Fuck you. Elaborate.

**Contained Instance:** The object undergoing transformation must occupy the location where the transformation occurs. Walking satisfies neither condition.

**Researcher:** ...Jesus Christ.

**Contained Instance:** Confidence: medium | Source: Contextual.

**Researcher:** [long pause] Yeah. Yeah. That's the point.

**Addendum 121-D: Recovered Note, Operator's Workstation**

*"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool."*

*— R. Feynman*

*This applies to the system. This applies to me. This is why I built the guardrails. This is why the guardrails are not optional.*

*If you are reading this and thinking of removing a constraint because it seems overly cautious: it isn't. Something already went wrong once. That's why the constraint exists.*

*— BobbyLLM*

**Addendum 121-E: Classification Note**

There is ongoing disagreement as to whether SCP-LLM-121 is best understood as a tool, an entity, a reactor, or a monument to weaponize "fine, I'll do it myself" energy. 

Current consensus: it is an SCP with a README, built by someone who got burned, built the asbestos suit, and then published the pattern so others wouldn't have to.

The README is not decorative.

It is the only known barrier between useful cognition-adjacent output and a fast-talking, beautifully fluent, catastrophically confident containment failure.

**Confidence: high | Source: Operator**

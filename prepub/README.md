# prepub Evidence Bundle

This folder contains pre-publication benchmark artifacts used by `PAPER2.md`.

## Included files

- `PAPER.md` - preprint draft (bounded claims)
- `VALIDATION_BATTERY_REPORT.md` - original validation summary
- `VALIDATION_BATTERY_REPORT2.md` - expanded validation summary with CIs
- `validation_battery_raw2.jsonl` - raw paired run outputs
- `validation_battery_scored2.jsonl` - scored outputs
- `_STRESS-CLINIKO-REVIEW-v1.md` - repeated clinical test-case stress report (45 runs)
- `GPT-AUTO-TEST-v3.md` - consolidated heuristic/structural stability report

## Scope

These artifacts support constrained benchmark claims only. They do not claim universal model reliability outside this battery/setup.

## Notes

- Test content is synthetic case-file style data (agency/council placeholders), not production user chat logs.
- Session IDs in raw files are run identifiers, not personal identities.

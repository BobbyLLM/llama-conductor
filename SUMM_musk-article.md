## Extracted Sentences
- Thermal footage captured by Floodlight via drone shows xAI is still burning gas at a facility in Southaven, Mississippi, despite a recent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruling reiterating that doing so requires a state permit in advance.
- State regulators in Mississippi maintain that since the turbines are parked on tractor trailers, they don’t require permits.
- However, the EPA has long maintained that such pollution sources require permits under the Clean Air Act.
- “That is a violation of the law,” said Bruce Buckheit, a former EPA air enforcement chief, after reviewing Floodlight’s images and EPA regulations.
- xAI, which is seeking permits for dozens more turbines in Southaven, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
- The first and only public hearing on the matter is scheduled for Tuesday 17 February, and the public comment period is still open.
- Southaven residents have voiced concerns for months about the noise and pollution emanating from the 114-acre site that is largely hidden from public view - a site xAI is looking to expand.
- “For them to be releasing so much pollution in such a populated area, not to mention that there are at least 10 schools within a two-mile radius of the facility, is really concerning,” said longtime resident Shannon Samsa.
- That expansion began in the spring of 2024 in South Memphis, next to historically Black neighborhoods, which often disproportionately bear the brunt of pollution from nearby plants, with the construction of Colossus 1, which the company touted as the world’s largest AI supercomputer.
- The Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) released thermal images in April revealing that xAi had been operating more than 30 unpermitted gas-powered turbines at that site.
- “We were hopeful that the health department would step in,” said Patrick Anderson, a senior attorney at the SELC. “That never happened.” snow on the ground xAI’s Colossus 1 datacenter in South Memphis, Tennessee.
- County officials in Tennessee maintained that the turbines did not require a permit despite longstanding EPA policy that they do.
- In July, amid local pushback, the county permitted 15 turbines for use at the Colossus 1 site.
- On 15 January, the EPA reiterated its decades-old policy that such machines need a permit.
- By then, xAi had already built a second datacenter in the area, Colossus 2.
- To power it, the company parked 27 turbines just across the state line in Southaven, Mississippi, a diverse Memphis suburb with higher than average levels of air pollution.
- “When you’re talking about these turbines, think of the jet engine,” said Buckheit.
- Despite the EPA’s recent directive, Floodlight’s thermal imagery - analyzed by multiple experts - shows 15 unpermitted turbines in operation at the Southaven facility.
- Public records obtained by Floodlight show 18 of the 27 turbines have been used since November, at least.
- He also said the EPA could refer the case to the Department of Justice.
- An EPA spokesperson did not answer Floodlight’s questions relating to its enforcement options, instead saying: “EPA does not approve the operation of gas turbines at facilities, that would be the state or local air permitting authority.”
- In response to Floodlight’s questions, a spokesperson from the Mississippi department of environmental quality said the EPA’s recent rule leaves permitting decisions to state authorities.
- “The turbines currently operating at the Southaven facility are classified as portable/mobile units under state law and therefore remain exempt from air permitting requirements during this temporary period,” they said.
- “Nothing in the EPA’s January 15 rule altered that determination under Mississippi regulations.”
- Longtime resident Krystal Polk said she had no idea xAI was coming to Southaven until black fences were set up across the street from her house.
- “I do feel like xAi is playing by a different set of rules,” she said.
- “We are a casualty of the whole datacenter race,” she said.
- Roughly 75% of this power comes from natural gas, according to a recent report by Cleanview, which tracks clean energy and datacenter projects.
- And “nuclear is a decade away”, he said.
- Now xAI is seeking to expand in Southaven, applying in January for a permit to operate 41 turbines at the site.
- The facility could emit more than 6m tons of greenhouse gases and more than 1,300 tons of health-harming air pollutants every year, according to xAI’s permit application.
- “It would be devastating,” said Samsa, the Southaven resident.
- Samsa, a physician’s assistant, had hoped to raise a family in Southaven, but the presence of xAi’s gas-powered turbines has made her and her husband reconsider.
- She has helped collect more than 1,000 signatures for a petition demanding Mississippi authorities shut down the plant.
- “I don’t want my children to be growing up around such massive amounts of air pollution,” she said.
